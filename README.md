==========================================

The file run_analysis.R extracts data from an experiment involving 30 volunteers, 6 activities and the measurements of an accelerometer and gyroscope. The code merges the training and testing datasets together, removes extra homonymous columns and summarises the data by taking the means of all measurements for all subject:activity combinations. The resulting data frame is exported in a CSV format in the file summaryDataSet.csv.
