The merged dataset contains 479 variables on 30 volunteers and 6 activities. The volunteers are numbered from 1 to 30. This information is stored in the variable "subjectNumber". The activities are stored in the variable "activity". This variable has six different levels: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. The other 477 variables are the means of measurements of an accelerometer and gyroscope for each volunteer:activity combination.
